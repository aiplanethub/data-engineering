# Data Engineering Project

For the next three weeks, you will work on a Data Engineering Project.

The goal of this project is to apply everything we learned
in this course and build an end-to-end data pipeline.

Remember that to pass the project, you must evaluate the submissions of 3 peers. If you don't do that, your project can't be considered complete.  

## Problem statement

For the project, we will ask you to build a dashboard with two tiles. 

For that, you will need:

* Select a dataset that you're interested in (see [datasets](https://github.com/dphi-official/data-engineering/blob/main/week-7-8-9/datasets.md)).
* Create a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it into a data lake.
* Create a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse.
* Transform the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard.
* Create a dashboard.



## Data Pipeline 

The pipeline could be stream or batch: this is the first thing you'll need to decide.

* If you want to consume data in real-time and put them in a data lake, go with a stream pipeline.
* If you want to run things periodically (e.g. hourly/daily), go with a batch pipeline.


## Technologies 

You don't have to limit yourself to technologies covered in the course. You can use alternatives as well:

* Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure, or others
* Infrastructure as code (IaC): Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, ...
* Workflow orchestration: Airflow, Prefect, Luigi, ...
* Data Warehouse: BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, ...
* Batch processing: Spark, Flink, AWS Batch, ...
* Stream processing: Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis, ...

If you use something that wasn't covered in the course, 
be sure to explain what the tool does.

If you're not certain about some tools, ask on the [DPhi Discord Server](https://discord.gg/E2XfSEYm2W).


## Dashboard

You can build a dashboard with any of the tools shown in the course (Data Studio or Metabase) or any other BI tool of your choice. If you do use another tool, please specify and make sure that the dashboard is somehow accessible to your peers. 

Your dashboard should contain at least two tiles, we suggest you include:

- 1 graph that shows the distribution of some categorical data. 
- 1 graph that shows the distribution of the data across a temporal line.

Make sure that your graph is clear to understand by adding references and titles.

## Submitting

* Form: https://forms.gle/KgnCGM5cgXUxk8Bb9
* Deadline: 21st July, 7:00 PM CET/ 10:30 PM IST

## Going the extra mile

If you finish the project and you want to improve it, here are a few things you can do:

* Add tests
* Use make
* Add CI/CD pipeline 

This is not covered in the course and this is entirely optional.

If you plan to use this project as your portfolio project, it'll 
definitely help you to stand out from others.

**Note**: this part will not be graded.

## Grading
- **Grade by Peers**: Each assignment will be reviewed by 3 peers. Only those people who have submitted their work will be considered in the peer-review process. Peers will score the assignment out of 26 marks. We will then take the median score out of the three peer ratings. This makes sure that if there is an outlier rating, we do not consider it. This median score is the marks you have obtained from the peer review.
- **Peer Review Completion**: Secondly, 14 marks are allotted for completing your peer review. This will be a binary score - if you complete your peer review, you will get the entire 14 marks, otherwise, it will be a zero. 
- **Final Score**: Your final score in this Bootcamp will be the sum of the marks from Grade by Peers and Peer Review Completion. This score will be out of 40 marks.
