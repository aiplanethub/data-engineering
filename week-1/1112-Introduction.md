# Prerequisites

* To get most out of this course, you should feel comfortable with coding and command line, and know the basics of SQL. Prior experience with Python will be helpful, but you can pick Python relatively fast if you have experience with other programming languages.
* Prior experience with data engineering is not require
* We suggest watching videos in the same order as in this document.
* The last video (setting up the environment) is optional, but you can check it earlier if you have troubles setting up the environment and following along the videos.
